The code generates short forms for words in a dictionary by considering all possible subsequences of lengths 1 to 4 for each word. It ensures uniqueness of generated subsequences using a set. After processing each word, it prints the generated short forms to the standard output. The approach efficiently constructs short forms by recursively generating subsequences and storing them in a set to avoid duplicates.
