The approach used in the provided code is to iterate through the sorted array of numbers. During this iteration, it maintains a variable `j`, which represents the maximum sum that can be formed using the elements encountered so far.

The algorithm iterates through each element in the array. For each element encountered, if it's greater than `j + 1`, it means there's a gap between the current maximum reachable sum and the next number in the array. To fill this gap, the algorithm patches the array by adding the next number in the sequence (`j + 1`). It then updates `j` accordingly. This process continues until `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.

If `j` becomes greater than or equal to `n` during the iteration, it means that all numbers in the range `[1, n]` can be formed using the elements encountered so far. At this point, the algorithm returns the number of patches applied, which represents the minimum number of patches required to satisfy the condition.

If, after processing all elements in the array, `j` is still less than `n`, it means that there are still some numbers in the range `[1, n]` that cannot be formed using the elements in the array. In this case, the algorithm continues to patch the array by adding elements that fill this gap until `j` becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Finally, it returns the total number of patches applied.
