The graph is constructed from the input pairs, with each pair representing an edge. During this process, the indegree and outdegree of each vertex are tracked.

A suitable starting vertex is found based on the outdegree and indegree of each vertex, aiming to initiate the traversal. For an Eulerian path, the starting vertex must satisfy either of the following conditions:

->The starting vertex must have indegree(start) + 1 = outdegree(start) or indegree(start) = outdegree(start). This ensures that the initial vertex has one more outgoing edge than incoming edges or equal incoming and outgoing edges, respectively.
->For an Eulerian cycle, the starting vertex must have indegree(start) = outdegree(start).

A depth-first search (DFS) traversal is then performed, starting from the determined starting vertex. This traversal explores the graph, ensuring that all vertices and edges are visited.

Subsequently, the valid arrangement of pairs is constructed based on the order of visited vertices, utilizing the post-order traversal sequence obtained from DFS.

For an Eulerian path, the terminal vertex must satisfy either of the following conditions:

The terminal vertex must have indegree(end) = outdegree(end) + 1 or indegree(end) = outdegree(end). This ensures that the terminal vertex has one more incoming edge than outgoing edges or equal incoming and outgoing edges, respectively.
For an Eulerian cycle, if the starting vertex is the same as the terminal vertex (start = end), it must have indegree(end) = outdegree(end).

In cases where the number of pairs in the result does not match the input, indicating that no valid arrangement is possible, a message is outputted to indicate this outcome.
