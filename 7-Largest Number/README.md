Initially, the strings are sorted in lexicographical order. While this approach works well for single-digit numbers, it fails in cases like 30 and 3. Lexicographically, 30 is greater than 3, leading to an incorrect result of 303 as the largest number. However, the correct largest number from these two numbers is 330. To address this, we utilize a comparator function:

We concatenate two strings, 'a' and 'b', in two different orders: 's1 = a + b' and 's2 = b + a'. Then, we compare these concatenated strings to ensure the correct order. Rephrased:

Two concatenated strings, 's1' and 's2', are formed by combining 'a' and 'b' in different orders. We compare these strings to determine their order, ensuring that the resulting comparison accurately reflects the intended numerical order.
